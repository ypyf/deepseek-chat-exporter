# Icon Files for DeepSeek Chat Exporter

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editor. The icons should be in PNG format with transparency.

## Suggested Icon Design

A simple design suggestion would be:
- A chat bubble or document icon
- With an arrow pointing downward (representing export)
- Using DeepSeek's brand colors if applicable

## Placeholder Icons

Until you create custom icons, you can use placeholder icons from various icon libraries or generate simple ones using online tools like:

1. https://favicon.io/
2. https://www.canva.com/
3. https://www.figma.com/

Remember to create all three sizes for proper display in different contexts within Chrome.
